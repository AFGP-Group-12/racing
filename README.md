**Instructions**

Simply run executable :D

**Known/unfixed bugs**
- If the server is done, there are some places in the main menu you can get soft-locked.
- In some instances, the player grapple can cause players to clip through walls.
- Sometimes the player grapple line artifacts and stays present.
- Transitioning between levels does not work as intended. Players are supposed to turn into ghosts and spectate, but currently 
they are still able to participate in the level.
- The results scene is created, but at the end of the final level, you do not transition to it. There is no transition out of 
the third level.
